# Diamonds Price Prediction and Image-Based Quality Assessment

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **diamond prices** using machine learning techniques. It was developed as part of a **Machine Learning course** to explore data preparation, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Additionally, an exploratory bonus task on **image-based quality assessment** was included, though not extensively developed. Future improvements are planned for the image-based component.

## Features
- **Price Prediction Task:**
  - Comprehensive analysis of features influencing diamond prices.
  - Tested a wide range of machine learning models.
- **Image-Based Quality Assessment:**
  - Preliminary exploration of image data for quality classification.
  - Limited development with potential for future improvements.
- **Extensive Analysis:**
  - Interpretation of model performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for machine learning models and evaluation)
- **TensorFlow** (for deep learning exploration)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive data analysis and modeling)

## Project Structure
- **Data Preparation and Analysis Notebook:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Feature engineering and visualization.
- **Prediction Notebook:**
  - Model training and evaluation.
  - Comparison of various machine learning algorithms.
  - Initial attempts at image-based quality prediction using TensorFlow.

## Datasets
- The dataset includes detailed information on diamond features (e.g., carat, cut, clarity, color, and price) and images.
